On the 3rd of February 14 members of AberCompSoc will be travelling to the [Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting](https://fosdem.org/2017/) (FOSDEM) hosted at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.

This will be our first International trip as a society and will give members an opportunity to immerse themselves in the open source community and engage with new and exciting projects in addition to experiencing the local culture. 

Our very own Nathan Hughes will be giving a lighting talk at the event on [Gravimetric Phenotyping](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/gravimetric_phenotyping/) 

FOSDEM runs from the 4th-5th of February and is free as in beer, if you consider the cause worthwhile please consider [donating](https://fosdem.org/2017/support/donate/) or [volunteering](http://volunteers.fosdem.org).
